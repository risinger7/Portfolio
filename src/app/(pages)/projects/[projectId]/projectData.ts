      "Clira is a startup focused on transforming the procurement landscape by streamlining processes through advanced web technology. With a focus on both public and private procurements, Cliraâ€™s mission is to maximize competition while minimizing corruption. During my 8-month internship, I contributed to the platform by building features with a modern tech stack, including Laravel, React, Next.js, and Docker. For my final project at Clira, I developed an inventory feature based on a provided design, enabling customers to manage their stock more efficiently. This experience strengthened my skills in both frontend and backend development and taught me how to navigate a professional environment, enhancing my ability to work both collaboratively and independently as a programmer.

The platform connects families looking to give away gently used toys with those in need, creating an easy way to give toys a second life. This was my first project using React and working collaboratively with others. My primary focus was on implementing secure user authentication, where I learned about JWT tokens and security best practices. Although the website is no longer active and was created mainly for learning purposes, it provided me with foundational experience in frontend development and secure login systems.",
